A list of dev/tech accounts supporting the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Feel free to add yourself. Website created and maintained by [Lewis Menelaws](https://twitter.com/LewisMenelaws)

This project is a fork of [/uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com). Styling and content has been changed but a lot of the work is from that repository. Thank you Wes.

## What is BlackLivesMatter.dev

BlackLivesMatter.dev is a website for developers to showcase their support for the Black Lives Matter movement. It is an open source project to spread awareness for the #BlackLivesMatter movement. BlackLivesMatter.dev isn't officially affiliated with the official [#BlackLivesMatter organization](https://blacklivesmatter.com).

## What is the goal of BlackLivesMatter.dev?

BlackLivesMatter.dev is to help show support and spread awareness through #BlackLivesMatter through the tech/developer community. It's to help developers help find others who support #BlackLivesMatter and achieve the goals of the movements (donation matching, awareness, etc).

## How can I help?

If you are looking to help with the #BlackLivesMatter foundation, you can donate to #BlackLivesMatter and spread the word on your social media. For help specifically with BlackLivesMatter.dev, you can submit your name or submit a pull request / issue if you run into errors.

## What should I submit?

Ideally, what you should submit is a link to where your support is. For example, if you are showing support on Twitter, please set the link to that specific tweet so when someone clicks on it, they can go right to the tweet and interact further.

## What is the hierarchy?

There isn't any. The data is randomized on build. So whenever a new person is added, it will shuffle everyone. Use the tags to filter specifics.

## I have more questions.
